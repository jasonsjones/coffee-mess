# Coffee Mess

Simple MEAN stack web application focusing on JWT authentication.

This application is based closely on the code from Alexander Zanfir's Pluralsight
course, _Creating Apps With Angular, Node, and Token Authentication_.  There are a few
architectural differences between this project and the one developed during Alexander's
course, however, the main difference is that while Alexander's course uses a 'job board'
as the main resource, this project uses coffee--why you may ask...well, because I like coffee.

The course can be found [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-apps-angular-node-token-authentication)
